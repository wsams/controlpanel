controlpanel
============

A simple web application control panel for monitoring system resources or performing any number of custom actions.

Just clone this application and drop it in a web accessible location and open index.php.

It requires UNIX commands: w and last.

The page layout uses HTML5, Bootstrap 3 and jQuery 1.10 and automatically updates every 5 seconds - configurable in `cdn/js/siamnet/default.js`. Update `setTimeout()` function.
